# A3: Cache Simulator

For this assignment you will simulate a cache using Zig. 

You can write all the code into `main.zig` file, there is no need to modify anything else. Many things have been left in for you as well as the overall architecture of the program being decided. Again, this is needed for unit testing purposes. A full explanation of what needs to be done will be in Lecture Stream 11!
